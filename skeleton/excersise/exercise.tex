\zadanie Calculate using Knuth's division algorithm (the base of 10):\\
\[
\frac{5533}{13}
\]

%
\zadanie Calculate the rational numbers using the algorithms presented during laboratories:\\
\[
\frac{71}{17} + \frac{11}{34}
\]

%
\zadanie Calculate Extended Greatest Common Divisor for the following numbers:\\
\[
\mathrm{EGCD}(97,19)
\]

\zadanie Calculate the first step of Lehmer's algorithm (for 4-digit words):\\
\[
\mathrm{GCD}(4711~~2818, 1000~~0000)
\]
this is written in decimal, but the space sign
marks the border between digits.

\zadanie Invert the number in $Z_n$ using EGCD:\\
\[
\frac{1}{23} \equiv_{83} ?
\]

\zadanie Using Chinese remainder theorem solve the following
system of simultaneous congruences:\\
\[
\left\{
\begin{matrix}
x \equiv 3 \pmod{11}\\
x \equiv 4 \pmod{5}\\
x \equiv 7 \pmod{13}
\end{matrix}
\right.
